# 🚉 **KMRL IntelliDocs**
### *Smart Document Intelligence for Urban Infrastructure Projects*

---

## 💡 **Introduction**

### **Problem Statement**
Public infrastructure projects like those managed by Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) involve **thousands of technical documents** — project plans, inspection reports, tenders, and contractor submissions.  
Currently, most of these are **scattered across folders**, manually verified, and **lack intelligent search or version control**, leading to delays, duplication, and loss of critical insights.

### **Solution**
**KMRL IntelliDocs** is an **AI-powered Intelligent Document Management System (IDMS)** built to automate the way metro and infrastructure organizations **store, analyze, and manage project documents**.  
By integrating **OCR, NLP, and cloud storage**, IntelliDocs allows engineers, officials, and auditors to upload **PDFs, images, or reports** and instantly retrieve structured insights.  

Through a centralized, searchable dashboard, users can:
- Upload and categorize technical documents  
- Extract key information (dates, costs, contractor details)  
- Detect document duplicates or anomalies using AI  
- Enable role-based secure sharing with teams and departments  

IntelliDocs streamlines documentation, enabling **faster approvals, improved compliance, and transparent audit trails**.
